      <h2>Project Overview:</h2>
      <p><strong>Context:</strong> In Summer 2024, I collaborated with a team of five professionals, including one faculty member, one instructional designer, 
        one content expert, one instructor, and one teaching assistant, to design and develop a new undergraduate course, <strong>Digital Pedagogies and 
        Assistive Technologies</strong>. This course, launched in Fall 2024, was designed for pre-service teachers enrolled in inclusive elementary education, 
        math education, music education, and physical education programs. Over the course of three months, I worked with my team to plan and 
        structure the curriculum, while personally leading the design and development of two key sessions focused on emerging educational 
        technologies. Below is one of the training modules I created:</p>

      <h3>Training Module: Immersive Technologies for Educators</h3>
      <p>One of my primary contributions to this course was the creation of a <strong>three-hour training module</strong> that explores the 
        integration of three emerging technologies—<strong>Virtual Reality (VR), Augmented Reality (AR), and Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI)</strong>—into 
        educational settings. My work encompassed the following key areas:</p>
      
      <h3>Needs Assessment</h3>
      <p>To ensure the training module addressed the specific needs of pre-service teachers, I conducted a <strong>comprehensive needs assessment</strong>
        to identify knowledge and skill gaps in technology integration within the Teacher Preparation Programs. I used <strong>Qualtrics surveys</strong>
        to gather insights from faculty, instructors, and students, analyzing the data to inform the module’s design and objectives.</p>

      <h3>Curriculum Development</h3>
      <p>I designed and developed the training curriculum, which included:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>A structured <strong>course outline</strong> and detailed <strong>lesson plans</strong>.</li>
        <li><strong>Multimedia-rich presentations</strong> to enhance learning engagement.</li>
        <li><strong>Interactive activities</strong> that allow hands-on experience with VR, AR, and AI applications.</li>
        <li><strong>Assessments</strong> to evaluate understanding and skill development.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Content Creation and Adaption</h3>
      <p>I developed and curated <strong>engaging training content</strong> tailored to pre-service teachers’ needs, ensuring practical relevance 
        and accessibility. My work included:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Designing <strong>Blackboard course modules</strong> with structured content and intuitive navigation</li>
        <li>Creating an <strong>online learning interface</strong> featuring lesson plan examples and real-world use cases</li>
        <li>Adapting <strong>technical documentation, user guides, and knowledge base articles</strong> for an educational audience</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Collaboration and Project Management</h3>
      <p>Throughout the project, I effectively managed multiple projects from concept to completion under set development timelines. Balancing 
        independent work with collaborative efforts, I successfully designed and developed this training session, ensuring seamless integration 
        with the whole course development. This module incorporated diverse instructional activities and comprehensive teaching materials covering 
        three emerging technologies—VR, AR, and AI. By strategically coordinating resources, prioritizing tasks, and maintaining clear communication 
        with stakeholders, I ensured that all deliverables were completed on schedule without compromising quality.</p>

      <h3>Delivery Methods:</h3>
      <p>To accommodate diverse learning preferences, I designed and implemented <strong>multi-modal training delivery methods</strong>, including:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Instructor-led training (ILT)</strong> and <strong>virtual instructor-led training (VILT)</strong> sessions</li>
        <li><strong>Self-paced online learning modules</strong> for flexible access</li>
        <li><strong>Hands-on activities</strong> with VR, AR, and AI tools to enhance experiential learning</li>
      </ul>
      <img src="project_2_fig_5.png" alt="Blackboard Screenshot">

      <h3>Evaluation and Continuous Improvement</h3>
      <p>I developed a <strong>theory-based evaluation framework</strong> to assess the training module’s effectiveness, focusing on:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Pre-service teachers’ TPACK (Technological Pedagogical Content Knowledge) development</strong> (Mishra & Koehler, 2006)</li>
        <li><strong>Self-efficacy and interest levels</strong> in adopting new technologies in teaching</li>
        <li><strong>Effectiveness of instructional strategies and content delivery</strong></li>
      </ul>
      <p>Using <strong>Qualtrics surveys</strong>, I collected and analyzed evaluation data to measure learning outcomes and identify areas for improvement.</p>
      <img src="project_2_fig_6.png" alt="Students Feedback Screenshot">
      <p>Additionally, I adapted the <strong>university’s course feedback evaluation</strong> for mid-course and post-course assessments. This helped 
        assess <strong>instructional effectiveness</strong> and <strong>students’ learning experiences</strong>, ensuring the course remained responsive 
        to learners’ needs. Data-driven insights from these evaluations were used to refine the training materials and delivery methods.</p>

      <h3>Conclusion</h3>
      <p>By leveraging emerging technologies, employing the well-established ADDIE model, designing theory-based instructional strategies, and implementing 
        rigorous evaluation methods, I created this high-quality online training module that equips pre-service teachers with the skills and confidence to 
        integrate cutting-edge technologies into their teaching practices.</p>
      <p>This training module was launched for the first time in the Fall of 2024; I viewed it as a pilot study. Through pre- and post-training 
        surveys, I was delighted to find that students’ self-efficacy and interest in technology integration showed significant improvement. I 
        documented my findings in a research paper, which was accepted by the American Education Research Association (<strong>AERA</strong>). I am 
        honored to present my study at the <strong>AERA Annual Meeting</strong> in April 2025 in Denver as <strong>the first author</strong>.</p>
