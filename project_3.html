    <h2>Project Overview</h2>
    <h3>Context:</h3>
    <p>As generative AI tools like ChatGPT, Copilot, and DALL·E are increasingly adopted across higher education, faculty and teaching staff are navigating new opportunities and new challenges. While AI can support efficiency, personalization, and creativity in teaching, many educators are still unfamiliar with its ethical and legal implications, especially in real-world instructional practice.</p>
    <p>In particular, <strong>accessibility</strong> is often overlooked in conversations about AI in education. Too often, accessibility is treated as a technical requirement or legal checkbox, rather than a meaningful part of inclusive, learner-centered design.</p>
    <p>This course was developed to address that gap.</p>

    <h3>Overview:</h3>
    <p>This course helps faculty, instructors, and teaching assistants use AI tools to create more accessible, inclusive, and learner-centered digital teaching materials. From checking alt text to crafting content for different student needs, the course combines practical guidance with hands-on activities. No prior AI experience required—just curiosity and care for your learners.</p>
